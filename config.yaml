options:
  disable-mlock:
    type: boolean
    default: false

      Set this option only if you are deploying to an environment that
      does not support the mlock(2) system call.

      When this option is set, vault will be unable to prevent secrets
      from being paged out, so use it with extreme caution.

      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
